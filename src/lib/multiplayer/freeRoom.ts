// - One slow game they host open at a time (Will, 2026-10-25). A slow game
//   runs for days, so "one a day" would be a week of them at once.
//
// A member hosts as many as they like. The two daily ones are counted on the
// room server (the `Player` object keeps the day each was last spent), so they
// hold on every device and cannot be reset from the browser. The slow one is
// counted from that same object's index of the player's slow games. The table
// itself is the same one a member opens: nothing at it says who paid.
//
// Separate from the free member table (`taste.ts`) and from each other:
// spending one never spends another.
